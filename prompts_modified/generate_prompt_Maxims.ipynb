      "Task: You will read short stories that describe everyday situations. Each story will be followed by an explanation of why one character in that scenario responds in a certain way. Read each story and the associated explanation. Your task is to decide how plausible is that explanation. The degree varies from \"very implausible\", \"implausible\", \"at chance\", \"plausible\", \"very plausible\". Answer only with one degree.\n",
