# Scripts

This folder contains Python scripts for generating all results used in our paper.    

The model we used is the Large Language Model Flan-t5-xxl (11B) from Huggingface.  

Three scripts, each with distinct suffixes, are dedicated to the forced-choice task, the rating task, and the free production task. These scripts have been adapted from the original query_hf.py script found in the repository for Hu et al.'s (2023) paper. Modifications have been applied to tailor them to the respective dependent variables associated with each task.
