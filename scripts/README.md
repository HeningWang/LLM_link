# Scripts

This folder contains Python scripts for generating all results used in our paper.    

Three scripts, each with distinct suffixes, are dedicated to the forced-choice task, the rating task, and the free production task. These scripts have been adapted from the original query_hf.py script found in the repository for Hu et al.'s (2023) paper. Modifications have been applied to tailor them to the respective dependent variables associated with each task.

Playgrounds are for testing with different models.
