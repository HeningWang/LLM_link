# Human data

Human data in the `fj` folder are taken from Floyd, Jouravlev, et al. (in prep).
These are the main data against which models are compared in the main analyses of our paper.

Human data in the `no_story` folder were collected in a new behavioral experiment, described in Section 5.3.2 of our paper.
