# Human data

Human data in this folder are taken from Floyd, Jouravlev, et al. (in prep).
These are the main data against which different dependent variables are compared in the main analyses of our paper.

In Hu et al. (2023) original paper, they looked at in total of 7 phenomena. We focus here only on Gricean Maxims. Therefore, here are only human data tested on that phenomenon.
