PhenomenonInstructions.txt is the instructions humans got at the start of the particular phenomenon's section.

PhenomenonKeySimple.txt is the simple correct/incorrect coding. First column is the phenomenon (for example, HV stands for HumourVerbal, meaning these are the options given to people in the Verbal (meaning textual, as opposed to pictorial or auditory) format. Second column is the item number (people didn't always see these items in this order, though in some they did). Third column is the option number (such as "D. He stepped on a rake and hit himself in the face.").

PhenomenonOptions.txt are the answer options people saw. Again, first column is the phenomenon (for example, HV stands for HumourVerbal, meaning these are the options given to people in the Verbal (meaning textual, as opposed to pictorial or auditory) format. Second column is the item number (people didn't always see these items in this order, though in some they did). Third column is the option number (such as "D. He stepped on a rake and hit himself in the face.").

PhenomenonScenarios.txt are the scenarios. Only two identifier columns here: phenomenon (HV for example), and item number. Of course, people saw the same scenario for all answer options of an item :)


A note: These are only the items which invite pragmatic/non-literal inferences. For many of the phenomena (such as Irony), there were twice as many items, and each was closely matched in a literal version. These are removed for the purpose of testing LMs.
